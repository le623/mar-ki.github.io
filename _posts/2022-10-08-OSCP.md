# Summary 

After I planned for a couple of years to get my OSCP the time had finally come.
In early 2022 I decided to go for it, get through the course, the labs and tackle the exam in the end.

# Timeline

Don't expect a fully in detail timeline from me as I only did some labs when I had some spare time beside my main job.

| DATE     | ACTION                                                                              |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10.01.22 | Able to access the PEN-200 Course                                                   |
| 01.06.22 | Started to do PG boxes a couple of hours per week and dive into the lab environment |
| 05.08.22 | Heared about Bonus Point Changes and started to work on obtaining them              |
| 10.09.22 | Long Vacation before Exam                                                           |
| 27.09.22 | Pre Exam Prep                                                                       |
| 04.10.22 | OSCP Exam                                                                           |

There were just two times where I had to grind a bit and work my ass off as some would say.

## Bonuspoints

I thought getting 10 bonus points is a nice move to have a little safety when everything fails.

To get those points you have to:
* **80% correct solutions** submitted for the PEN-200 Topic Exercises for _each_ Topic
* submit the **proof.txt of at least 30** PEN-200 Lab Machines

Grinding out 100% correct solutions and obtaining 36 flags on the lab took me roughly 1,5 weeks of dedicated work. The labs are pretty old and did not really provide any value to me, pwning machines was kind of easy.

Don't underestimate how lang it takes to boot, stop or even restart a topic exercise vm. They can take up to 30 minutes before they are reachable and you have to clear ~124 of them :)

## Pre Exam Prep

Great time, I started to work on any missing Proving Ground Boxes that are authored by "Offsec". Those are most similar to the exam environment in my opinion and give you a clearer view on what to expect. 

Took my time and also pwned any machine that I already previously solved.

For AD Prep it's enough to tackle XOR, SVCORP in the lab and both sets in the topic exercises. If you are confident in pwning them you are good to go.

> By the way: After you pwned a machine, you can take a look at the intended way by viewing the official walkthroughs

# Exam

My exam was set to take place on October 4th around 10:00 AM. Thought that's a good time to get started even if my sleep schedule was pretty damaged at this point. Got good six hours of sleep before I woke up at 07:00 AM and started that day early with good music.

## Exam Timeline

| TIME          | ACTION                                                                  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10:00 - 10:45 | Debugging my fresh kali installation, bleeding edge is not always a win |
| 10:45 - 12:15 | Standalone 1: Low Privs + System Shell                                  |
| 12:15 - 12:45 | Break                                                                   |
| 12:45 - 15:00 | AD Set: From Zero to Hero                                               |
| 15:00 - 19:00 | Break                                                                   |
| 19:00 - 21:00 | Standalone 2: Low Priv + System Shell                                   |
| 21:00 - 23:00 | Break                                                                   |
| 23:00 - 02:00 | Standalone 3: Low Priv + System Shell                                    |

Took round about 6-8 hours of real hands on work, the rest was formatting notes, screenshotting and comparing hashes in exam panel to what I discovered on the box as user or root.

## Exam Difficulty

For me it seemed reasonabale in regards to what the course is teaching you.

The AD Set was straight forward and had a nice collection of different little obstacles that you could encounter in a real AD environment.

There was just one machine where I got stuck for around 2 1/2 hours on the priviledge escalation. The privesc vector was unknown to me but was spotted within a couple of minutes after getting my user shell. Can't go into detail but in the end it was probably the easiest of those machines and could have been done in 30 minutes.

# Results

After submitting my report I had to wait a day until I was able to see the final results on my exam dashboard.

And guess what? I..

I can't go into details on what I actually used on the exam but I can tell you what I prepared before my exam

Just add some tool for pivoting and rustscan in the mix and you are good to go when using a default kali installation.
